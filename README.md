# Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2022

## Project Brief
Build an inventory tracking web application for a logistics company. Requirements include basic CRUD Functionality. You should be able to:
- Create inventory items;
- Edit them;
- Delete them; and
- View a list of them.

You can tackle this challenge using any technology you want. This is an open-ended task, but we want to focus on high quality back-end code. Custom UIs and interactive frameworks like React are not necessary.

You can use frameworks, libraries and external dependencies to help you get to the parts you are interested in building, if this helps you; or start from scratch.

## Running the App
1. Ensure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed on your computer
2. Clone [the repo](https://github.com/lbisceglia/shopify) to your computer
3. In a terminal, navigate to the root folder of the repo and then run: `docker-compose up -d --build`
4. Open your web browser and go to `localhost:8000/api/items` to see the app**
5. Explore!

** Alternatively to using the browser, you may interact with the app via Postman HTTP requests to this address.

When building, consider how
more features could be added in the future.

## Future Features
- 'Export items as CSV' button
- Image thumbnails for items
